                         And you only have one chance to make it right.
                        <span>Every human being is fighting a battle inside themselves.
                        </span> It's your <span>obligation</span> to help and <span>inspire</span> them.
                        Regardless of what you do, you can always inspire others to do good. Nobody is better than you.
                        <span>And you're not better than anybody else.
                        </span> Be humble. Being in the <span>comfort zone</span> is wonderful, but nothing ever grows there. Keep studying. 
                        <span>Keep creating.</span> Haters will come if you have the <span>audacity to build something new</span>.
                        Don't let them define you. <span>Don't let them stop you.</span> Just block them and keep going.
                        Don't expect <span>others to make you happy</span>.
                        You are the only one <span>responsible for your happiness</span>. <span>Don't wait</span> until friday to enjoy life. Joy should be present in everything you do. <span>Be kind to your parents</span>. They gave up many things for you. Having hundreds of <span>people admiring you</span> is worthless, if you're not admired by your own family. Don't fear the unknown. Fear knowing everything. <span>Life is too damn short</span> and every day counts. <span>Do what you wanna do and do it now</span>. Tick-tock don't stop. Tick-tock don't wait.
